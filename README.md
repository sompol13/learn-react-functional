### React functional programming (useContext + useReducer)
Just a try project to use hooks `useReducer` + `useContext` as functional programming.

### Short Answer (My Opinion)
- This concept good enough for stateful component __useCreateTicket__
- But you should avoid having "different logic state" and calling custom hook on parent component.
